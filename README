To compile you need a compiler & make utility. I would suggest the GNU toolset, as this is what I am compiling with. However, the code is standard enough that it should compile Damn Near Anywhere.

If you are building a project from this code, the code-base itself is flat and relative: keep all the code as it is, here, and it should compile just fine.

To compile:

make

Or:

make all -jX

Where `X' is one more than the number of processors and `all' means `all' projects. Optionally:

make Info

Builds just fcsinfo

make Convert

Builds just fcsconvert

make Test

Builds just fcstest (out-of-data)

make FCSxToHR

Builds fcstofchr and fchrtofcs
